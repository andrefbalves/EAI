When my boyfriend and I arrived after a - hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only -- minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful. \nThe room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. \nThe Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) \nOverall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!","n":1,"cleanedText":"booked three nights

was in town for a conference at McCormick Place and stayed at the Wyndham Blake for two nights. Yes, the location is slightly away from the main flow of traffic but that is what made it great for me. Quiet area. Short taxi ride to MP was fine with me as well. Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. \nThe hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold.

Good - The room was really just my taste.

Their free breakfast was really like a mini-buffet, notice I did not say continental. It was really huge, or at least larger than other hotel chain's continental breakfast.

The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower. \nThe room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow.\nAll the fixtures and fittings, looked to be brand new. Be warned though as some of the mini bar items, water, ect, snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free. \nWe did have room service once and it was good and reasonably priced. We ate at Bin-- for breakfast a few times and found it very nice indeed.\nThere is a new Bar called The Crimson Lounge, gosh this place looked like a Vampire's Lure, very gothic, red and so dark, you could hardly see the person sat next to you on some tables. It was very busy on the weekend we where there, with lots of young girls aged around -- - --, dressed to impress, not our cup of tea really.\nWe did like Chicago, not so much as NY but we managed to see lots of sights. \nHarry Carays is a nice Bar ect. We also at at SMith and Wollensky but to be honest the over bearing waiter really put ut off. \nALl in all the Sax is very well placed in the Marina, right next to the House Of Blues, were you can watch blues and eat good food, we managed to go on Sunday for the Brunch and gospel Choir, was fantastic and en experience. \nOur only gripe was our view out of the windows, of the Corn Cob Towers, the car park hosts the first -- floors, so being on floor --, we had a view of the spiral car park and also the noise. \nHowever all in all it was a great hotel and well worth the money.","n":1,"cleanedText":"booked stay hotel sax chicago hotelscom good deal last minute too\non arrival impressed lobby area small bright airy crystal glass cabinets around doormen attentive too

am becoming a loyal Marriott customer, due to the really clean rooms, thoughtful furnishings, and comfortable beds and linens that one typically finds as a standard, but this time, I was bit annoyed that we didn't have the hotel at its full capacity. Parts of the hotel and the grounds are undergoing renovations, which we didn't find out until the day we arrived, so fair warning for anyone reading this review. On the other hand, the location near the convention center and other restaurants and shops is ideal for those who like to walk and explore during their trips. (Tip: Listen to the SD natives who kind of look askance when the idea of visiting Old Town is the topic. We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference.

You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas.

stay at the Jolly Madison over the Xmas period, the main feature is it's location. You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas.

They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. \n-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. \n-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...\nI'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.\nThe pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment.

very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...\nI'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.\nThe pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.\nI've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed.

I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value. The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"did I get a good deal?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\nThe first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.\nUpon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----. Be sure to check AAA and government rates if you qualify.","n":1,"cleanedText":"first stay kimpton property friday business trip dc booked room donovan house criteria mind location value location

first stay at a Kimpton property was on a Friday, for a business trip in DC. I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value. The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"did I get a good deal?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\nThe first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.\nUpon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----. Be sure to check AAA and government rates if you qualify.","n":2,"cleanedText":"first stay kimpton property friday business trip dc booked room donovan house criteria mind location value location

It was terrible, rundown and the service was the worst. The concierge tried to rip me off on a ride to the airport and when I questioned her overpriced quote, she told me that if I didn't like it, go ask the doorman for advice on car services.\nOne elevator was out of service, yet they didn't tell me that when I made the reservations. I had this problem once before during holiday time with a NY hotel, so had I have known, I would have made other accommodations.\nOne night, there were dirty towels or something left in the sink by the housekeeper that day, who obviously was in so much of a rush, she left the items in the sink. Disgusting.\nWhen I made reservations and then when I checked in, I asked for a room with a view. My view was the back alley next door. Bait and switch.\nThe hotel room and whole hotel is shabby. I tried to move out to another hotel the day I checked in, but being Thanksgiving week, it was hard to find other accommodations since the city is full.

I had this problem once before during holiday time with a NY hotel, so had I have known, I would have made other accommodations.\nOne night, there were dirty towels or something left in the sink by the housekeeper that day, who obviously was in so much of a rush, she left the items in the sink. Disgusting.\nWhen I made reservations and then when I checked in, I asked for a room with a view. My view was the back alley next door. Bait and switch.\nThe hotel room and whole hotel is shabby.

For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. \nAs a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from - stars to - stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking - star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong.\nI rated my experience at the W a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-,\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" but it was closer to a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-.--\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and just like in math class, I rounded down.

I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the --th floor, so that noise from the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"L\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! \nMy bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.\nThe room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At -'-\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\", --- lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that.\nThe television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"If this is a - star hotel, where is the plasma TV?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I have stayed at many other - star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. \nI liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop.\nThe bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"debris\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night.\nThe service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.\nThe location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity.\nOverall, this is not a - star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit. I decided not to patronize the restaurant (Shikago) or bar (Whiskey Blue) because there are many other places in Chicago I'd rather spend my money. Please do your research.

stay at the W City Center was a Dr. Jekyll- Mr. Hyde type ordeal. For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. \nAs a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from - stars to - stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking - star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong.\nI rated my experience at the W a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-,\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" but it was closer to a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-.--\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" and just like in math class, I rounded down. I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings, but for service, the W City Centre is a solid \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"-.-,\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" but that's as good as it gets.\nMy flight landed at Midway at about -:-- am, so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around --:-- am. I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the --th floor, so that noise from the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"L\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! \nMy bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.\nThe room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At -'-\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\", --- lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that.\nThe television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"If this is a - star hotel, where is the plasma TV?\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" I have stayed at many other - star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. \nI liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop.\nThe bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"debris\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night.\nThe service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.\nThe location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity.\nOverall, this is not a - star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit. I decided not to patronize the restaurant (Shikago) or bar (Whiskey Blue) because there are many other places in Chicago I'd rather spend my money. Please do your research. The W City Center is a great -.--- star hotel. It's not even close to being - stars.","n":2,"cleanedText":"stay w city center dr jekyll mr hyde type ordeal every task well equal opposite task flopped \nas former frequent traveler stayed different

After all, the location is excellent and it was one of the best priced Marriott properties in the area. We are Marriott Rewards members and always try to seek out their properties when it is time to book a vacation.\nThis time we decided to book a corner room because from seeing photos, they have a better layout and far better kitchen-area seating. Plus you have more windows. We ended up in one on the --th floor with a view up -th Avenue where you could see the beginning of Central Park. Plus, we had a partial view of the Chrysler Building.\nI'll start with what is good about this hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. The free breakfast is quite adequate---decent food if nothing to write home about. Also, the maids who cleaned our room during the course of the week did a great job. It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.\nSo...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating. The granite countertop on the kitchen table had some indelible stains. However, what really got to us is this --- everyday the towels and wash cloths smelled unclean and were dingy. Plus some were even ripped or looked flea-bitten. This was very off-putting. Also, the hot water tended to go out from time to time. During peak times when many are showering, it is understandable. However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!\nWe never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that?

After all, the location is excellent and it was one of the best priced Marriott properties in the area. We are Marriott Rewards members and always try to seek out their properties when it is time to book a vacation.\nThis time we decided to book a corner room because from seeing photos, they have a better layout and far better kitchen-area seating. Plus you have more windows. We ended up in one on the --th floor with a view up -th Avenue where you could see the beginning of Central Park. Plus, we had a partial view of the Chrysler Building.\nI'll start with what is good about this hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. The free breakfast is quite adequate---decent food if nothing to write home about. Also, the maids who cleaned our room during the course of the week did a great job. It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.\nSo...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating. The granite countertop on the kitchen table had some indelible stains. However, what really got to us is this --- everyday the towels and wash cloths smelled unclean and were dingy. Plus some were even ripped or looked flea-bitten. This was very off-putting. Also, the hot water tended to go out from time to time. During peak times when many are showering, it is understandable. However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!\nWe never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that? Is the hotel cutting corners when it comes to properly laundering the towels? Are the plumbing problems being worked on?\nWould we stay here again? The verdict is still out on that one. What I'm going to do is closely monitor the reviews here to see if things improve. If they have, we certainly would stay again.","n":2,"cleanedText":"okso decided stay again all location excellent one best priced marriott properties area marriott rewards members always try seek
